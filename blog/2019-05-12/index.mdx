As songwriters, we can put a lot of pressure on ourselves when it comes to our work. We become very critical, which causes us to abandon songs before we finish them. However, finishing songs not only makes us better songwriters, but we often find that the finished song isn't as bad as we thought while making it.

Here's three ways that can help us finish more songs more often.

1. Look at it as a journey

One reason we are so hard on ourselves is that we want every song to be the best work we ever created. If you're a beginner, or haven't been consistently songwriting, it's important to lower your expectations of what you create. It takes showing up regularly and creating time after time to reach a point where songs are meeting your expectations. So look at it as a journey and do you best to keep going.

2. Be a careless artist, *then* a ruthless editor

It's tempting to write a lyric or record a riff, rhythm, or melody and immediately want to delete it afterward. This is because we judge what we make as we make it. 
Instead, split your focus. First, think like a kindergartener and create without judgement. Only later after you have gotten all your ideas out, do you put on your editor hat and critique away. 

In the book, [https://www.amazon.com/Making-Music-Strategies-Electronic-Producers-ebook/dp/B00WHXYZG8](**Making Music: 74 Creative Strategies for Electronic Music Producers**), the chapter titled "Write drunk;edit sober" goes more in depth with this strategy.

3. Set deadlines

Sometimes putting pressure on ourselves can be a good thing. The pressure of time pushes us to make decisions quickly and move through the process of songwriting. 
You could join along with the [//reddit.com/r/songaweek](/r/songaweek) redditors and push yourself to write and release a song every week. If that's too intense, you can set your own deadline. 
Try to set discrete phases so you know what to focus on each day. For example these phases could be lyric writing, composing, arrangement, and production. 

Applying these tips have helped me create and finish more songs. Hopefully it helps you too!
